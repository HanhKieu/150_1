Everything seems to work. There is an issue with needing a newline character after a redirect(nothing that affects the functionality of the code).

For example, an example:
/../p1% ls > out.txt /.../p1%

Instead of  

/../p1% ls > out.txt 
/.../p1%

 Other than that, everything outputs cleanly, and redirects put everything in the file without a problem.
